Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming
language.[12][13][14] Its design philosophy emphasizes code
readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in
fewer lines of codethan would be possible in languages such as
C.[15][16]The language provides constructs intended to enable clear
programs on both a small and large scale.[17]

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including
object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural
styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory
management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.[18]

Like other dynamic languages, Python is often used as ascripting
language, but is also used in a wide range of non-scripting contexts.
Using third-party tools, Python code can be packaged into standalone
executable programs (such as Py2exe, or Pyinstaller[19]). Python
interpreters are available for many operating systems.

CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is free and open
source software and has a community-based development model, as do
nearly all of its alternative implementations. CPython is managed by
the non-profitPython Software Foundation.
